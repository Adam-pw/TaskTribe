# TaskTribe

### Introduction :
As a simple introduction we can say that habits are tasks or behaviors that we perform almost subconsciously. The main aim of the project is to find the accountability partner in forming good habits. From a leadership and management perspective it’s important to be aware of the power of habits because the habit your team members develop will shape their ability to deliver. If you can ingrain good habits, things will go well. If bad habits become ingrained, then you’ll have a much more difficult time delivering effectively.

### Problems : 
- Clearly, Adopting new habits and quitting the bad ones is Hard. Most addictive and destructive habits have a built in reward system that requires little or no input from you. Smoking a cigarette, snorting cocaine, or drinking yourself into oblivion are all easy habits to adopt because they light up your brain with the dopamine.
- On the other hand, many positive habits such as exercise, meditation, focused work, and healthy eating don’t have immediately obvious rewards. they need a little bit of help to get started.
- And sometimes, we begin a habit but are unable to keep it up. Either we lose the motivation to continue it, or we lose the interest. for eg, we can keep on writing our favorite book for a whole week but after can never go back at it from Monday.

### Solutions 
The main solution we are providing is AN ACCOUNTABILITY PARTNER.

so the first question that must arise in your head is **what is accountability?**

Accountability is the metric with which you can measure the impact and effect of each action and judge whether it will take you closer or farther away from your final goals and objectives. I like to say Accountability is simply; *doing the things you say you are going to do,* 
and *getting your team to do the same.*

**Why do we need an accountability partner in habits?**

it is not a journey that you need to take alone. Having someone to help us along this journey can be a fantastic motivating factor. It can help smooth out the rough creases in behaviour and also keep you on track when you feel your resolve slipping.

- An accountability partner is a professional expert whose entire job is to keep you in check and provide the required motivation so you can achieve your goals within specified deadlines.
- Apart from that, the partner will keep regular tabs on you to ensure you’re meeting your own expectations and achieving those goals. The accountability partner also gives you the appreciation to keep you motivated and consoles you when things don’t go your way.
